# Image-watermarking-Using-Computer-Vision

This project demonstrates how to add watermarks to images using OpenCV. Watermarking serves as a copyright measure, allowing organizations to secure their content and prevent unauthorized use without proper licensing or purchase. The project covers adding both logo and text watermarks to images.

## Overview
The objective is to create a simple yet effective method to add watermarks to images using computer vision techniques. This project utilizes OpenCV, NumPy, and PIL (Python Imaging Library) to achieve watermarking. Watermarks can be either logos or text, and the placement can be configured easily.

## Dataset
This project does not use a specific dataset. Instead, it fetches images and logos from URLs provided in the code. Users can replace these URLs with their own images and logos.

## Watermarking Techniques
The project demonstrates two main types of watermarking:

Logo Watermarking: Overlay a logo onto an image, typically in a corner or centered position.
Text Watermarking: Embed text onto an image, often used for branding or copyright information.

## Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
pip package installer


## Results
The watermarked images will be displayed using the default image viewer. You can see the effects of both logo and text watermarking. Adjust the positions and scaling as needed to fit your specific use case.

## Logo Watermark
An example of an image with a logo watermark added.

## Text Watermark
An example of an image with a text watermark added.
